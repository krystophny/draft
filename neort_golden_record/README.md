This is to reproduce the original NEO-RT results from Martitsch et al. 2016.
According to the dates, the runs entered the revised verion of the paper.

NEO-RT runs relevant for the main figures are
    - 2016-01-27_n1_magdrift
    - 2016-01-28_n1_nomag
    - 2016-03-11_n1_noshear
    - 2016-03-11_n1_shear

To get toroidal precession frequencies we ran
    - 160407_rmp90_torfreq

To double-check that higher harmonics do not affect the results, we also ran
    - 2016-02-22_n3_nomag
    - 2016-03-31_rmp_90_n3_noshear
    - 2016-03-31_rmp_90_n3_shear
